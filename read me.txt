This submission includes the original Western blot data (Figure S4) alongside the analysis and visualization scripts for the BLOT (Figure 4) and pY394 (Figure 4) datasets from the study titled "Tau is a Substrate for RPTPσ Family Receptor Tyrosine Phosphatases in Axon Extension and Neurodegeneration".

Specifically:

1. blots_data.txt: Contains raw Western blot data used for correlation analysis of proteins, including pY394, pT205, AT8, pT217,pT231, PHF-1 and pS422.

2. cor_plot.R: Contains the R scripts for conducting statistical correlation analysis and generating visualizations from blots_data.txt.

3. glm_plot.R: Includes R code for analyzing and visualizing the relationships between pY394 expression levels and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology markers (gpath and tangsqrt) using generalized linear models (GLMs).

4. Raw Western Blot Data for pY394 and AD Neuropathology: Available upon request.
